# My Summer of LeetCode 🌞

## Welcome to the Nerdy Side of Summer!

While everyone else is getting tan lines, I'm here getting... syntax errors. 🌊☀️💻

## What's This About? 🤔

Instead of sipping mojitos by the beach, I'm chugging tea and solving LeetCode or Geeks for Geek problems daily. This repo is my summer diary, filled with code instead of sunscreen.

## Why Am I Doing This? 💡

- **Avoiding Sunburn:** Who needs a tan when you can have a glowing screen?
- **Training to be a Code Ninja:** Because saving the world one algorithm at a time is cool, right?
- **Dodging Social Gatherings:** "Sorry, can't make it. I've got a hot date with a binary tree."

## What's Inside? 📦

- **Daily Code Confessions:** A new problem every day, because who needs free time?
- **Brain Dumps:** My thought process, aka "What was I thinking?!"
- **Snarky Comments:** Because some problems are just plain evil.
